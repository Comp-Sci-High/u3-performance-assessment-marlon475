-I picked this topic because it is always a very fun thing to learn random facts and details about animals and their habitats where they reside in.
-My API displays animals along with information about them and also displays habitats and information about them and which animals live in them. The available endpoints are /api/animals and /api/habitats
-It was pretty straightforward making my API since I had already had a clear idea of what I wanted it to be able to do going into the brainstorming. And with notes and other codepsace reference it was simple the steps I had to take to build my webpage.
